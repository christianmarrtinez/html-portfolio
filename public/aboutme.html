<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, My names Christian Martinez. I am a Software Developer from New York but I currently live in Miami, Florida. Half of my family is from Colombia and the other half is from Italy. So I have been blessed to eat very good food at home. I grew up playing and watching basketball. I love watching other sports as well like Boxing, Soccer, and American Football. I am skilled in Python, Javascript, and Node.js. I am also working on building my skillset in Databases such as mySQL and Postgres. As well as building my scripting skills in React.js.
